Zoe's Gift Idea List

So first of all: Thank you. 
Second of all: Some of these are can be expensive but this is also a list for me to keep track of the stuff I want. 

# Pokemon 

## Bundles 

### Crown Zenith

If you can find a booster bundle (Walmart) then I'd do that. Otherwise, the more packs for the price, the better.
ETBs are expensive and I wouldn't do those. But the Zacian Zamenzenta will give you more packs and they're *roughly* the same price

### Paradox Rift
Definitely either individual packs or booster bundles. I wouldn't do the boxes. 

### Pokemon 151
Anyone's game here. If you can find a booster bundle, then for sure those. 

## Singles
Singles can be fond on Ebay or through https://www.tcgplayer.com/. If you decide to go down the singles path, definitely grab near-mint because I'm in it for the pretty collectible art. 

When it comes to storing and wrapping: you're going to want to make sure it doesn't bend. Storing cards between card board and stuff? Always a good plan as long as there's a protective sleeve covering the card. Most shippers will keep things nice and clean for you. I would keep the cards like how they shipped them. 
### Tag Team Cards
1. if you get any of these then you're officially my most favoritest person every. 
2. they're all pricey, sooooo. $25 to one is fantastic and greatly appreciated. 
3. I would try to avoid the rainbow ones or the ones that look like 3D models. Definitely go for the pretty ones with the backgrounds.

Some to note: Umbreon & Darkrai, Garchomp & Giratina, the legendary bird trio (the one that looks like stained glass?), Mew & Mewtwo (there's one that looks Mew is giving Mewtwo a headache), and Espeon & Deoxys (Deoxys has it's "arms" out and there's this setting sun? Explosion? thing?).

I would definitely maybe, run this one by me. Since I won't have an updated list of which ones I have.

### Chilling Reign
Honestly? You could just pick some random alt arts from this set and it'd be a banger of a gift!

(Also, sorry for Moltres, I know. It's expensive, outside the budget... I will confess this is also a me list. For me. To irresponsibly buy cards)

1. [Tornadus V](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/241805/pokemon-swsh06-chilling-reign-tornadus-v-alternate-full-art?xid=pi850339ca-f44d-446a-88ab-e55683b7972a&page=1&Language=English)

### Lost Origin
Lost Origin is weird, it was very much a hit or miss set for me. Like, I liked it, don't get me wrong. It was great. It just... fell flat, other than the Giratina. Which created Lost Boxes. 


1. [Rotom V](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/284119/pokemon-swsh11-lost-origin-rotom-v-alternate-full-art?xid=pi883cb082-9609-43c1-9442-a0dc10b6c598&page=1&Language=English)

### Brilliant Stars
Brilliant Stars is also weird, I think it's a super underrated set! It's some very pretty cards imo.
