<b> MSI Pro B760-P WiFi vs MSI Pro Z790-A Max WiFi</b> 

MSI Pro Z790-A Max WiFi is *technically* the better motherboard. It's newer. Don't get me wrong the B760 is a great monitor and in some cases its better than the Z790. But, Z790 has more fan headers ( 8 v 7 ), more SATA ports ( 6 v 4 ). It's just more future proof, I suppose. Here's a solid comparison: \

If we're trying to cut a few bucks, this is probably one of those places you can cut a few bucks.

Look, I like Fractal and you wanted a optical drive. The black version is included in all the builds I have for this one. It's supposedly a little loud (stock case fans) but if you swap those out with... something else. You should be good. You'll need to triple check the number of fan headers though, which is all motherboard dependent. 

I didn't include the Sabrent thing because I couln't find it on PCPartPicker. I believe it uses another external 5.25" drive bay. So, I believe you should be good. This case allows for two external drives. 

Because I didn't include it in the build, I didn't include it in the price. 

General notes: most of these are built witha 970 EVO Plus 1TB + B760. If you're in the mood to upgrade and spend a little extra dough, this is what I'd upgrade first. PCPartPicker is your friend. Always. 

[Other choices for cases](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/case/#G=2,12)

### Option 1 ( Z790, i7 13th ) - $1712 - $1732

Look, I know. You said to keep it to $1600. 

Highlights: better motherboard


Note: I would probably nick a few more fans, they're like 15ish? each. Mostly because apparently the case stock fans are a little loud. If you use headphones and don't mind the noise, then fine. otherwise... you might want to get new fans. 

### Option 2  ( B760, i7 13th ) - 1616 - 1636

Alright, so this is the slightly worse motherboard. Otherwise this is identical to Option 1. 

### Option 3 ( B760, i5 12th ) - 1393 - 1413

See, I do listen to your budget requests! 

You have an extra $200 to play with! Like buying some fans. The ones I added are $65 and I guess that's just a me thing since I do work from home. Loud case fans wouldn't be super appealing to me. But that's just me. 

A few downsides: motherboard + cpu

An i5 12th Gen will absolutely be slower and eventually go the way of the Dodo sooner than the i7 13th Gen. You could technically upgrade the CPU independent of the motherboard. But uh, I wouldn't. If you do, you'll need new thermal paste.

To note: I'd absolutely swap the i5-12F for the i5-12k. The i5 12k is $170 (vs $150), and it's a better thing.

I didn't finish building this one out but you get the idea.


### Option 4 ( B760, i7 12th )  1482 - 1502

Look another thing? under budget? perish the thought. Kinda. Okay. it's *barely* under budget. But i'm counting it! Again, it's got the extra fans on it. So you'll need to nix those if you don't want them. Otherwise, again, identical to the other one. The i7 however, will be wayyyy faster than the i5. Okay, maybe not wayyyyy faster.

I didn't include the case fans as part of the price because they're technically optional. So they're ncie but not needed.

### Option 5 (B760, i5 13th) 

[PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/nWbXpB)

and this is the last one. If you're going to get an i5, I'd get this one.

Optional upgrades: fans ($65) and motherboard (Z790)
