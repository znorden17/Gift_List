# Prescott's PC 

## Needs
Games: Palworld, Hitman, Hearts of Iron 4
Other: General office-work, <b> Stable Diffusion </b> 
<b>Budget:</b> 1k - 1.5k
<b>Current System:</b> Alienware p96F001


## Pre-Built 
I know these are both out of the budget, but I figured I'd include them as a sort of comparison. It gives you a pros and cons to show you that you can definitely buy something pre-built and have that piece of mind + warranty, but you're paying a decent amount for the labor. All prices (unless noted) will be a cursory Google search and MSRP.

I will refer to the AMD as (AMD) and Intel as (INTEL). They're virtually identical computers, the only real difference is case + processor.

<b>Overview:</b> 4070 SUPER, Intel i7 13700k, 16GB DDR5, 1TB M.2 (WD Blue) 
Total: $1,695 (2/15, there's some sales) 
Normally: $1,955


<h5> GPU </h5> 

One of the few reasons I'd consider getting a pre-built is for the GPU. Mostly because of an availability thing. 

GPU - [$600](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-12gb-gddr6x-graphics-card-titanium-black/6570226.p?skuId=6570226)

<h5> Motherboard </h5> 

To keep this as honest as possible: I have a very similar motherboard to the Intel one and I've experienced two "issues" with it. (INTEL)

1. Needing to download the Internet drivers and stick it onto a flashdrive and then move it over to the new PC once I installed the OS.
2. For whatever reason, my external speakers refused to work. I ended up fixing this by directly plugging them into the monitor. 


AMD - $180

Intel - $180

I've always gone Intel. I did consider switching over to AMD. At one point, AMD had roughly the same processing as Intel for a much lower price. I don't really think that's the case anymore. Intel hasn't really changed in price, AMD has gone up. 

<h5> CPU </h5>

Intel & AMD: $370 

<h5> Hard Drive</h5>

They both have the WD Blue 1TB M.2, which is an okay drive. I, personally, am a huge fan of Samsung and generally lean towards them. 

$70. (Samsung's like 90? For the same 1TB.)

<h5> RAM </h5>

They're giving you one stick of 16GB DDR5, which is fine. It's just, you can get two sticks of 16GB (totally 32GB) for $95 and it's the same RAM that they're using. 

16GB DDR5 RAM: $42


<h5>Case</h5>

Lian Li is a good brand, they generally have good airflow, I cannot speak to AMETHYST 242 High Airflow (AMD).

Lian Li - $170

AMETHYST - $150(?)

I couldn't actually find anything on the AMETHYST. Since the Lian Li case is somewhere around $170, I figured the AMETHYST would be of comparable price. 

<h5> Cooling + PSU </h5> 

Mine was $160 and it was a 1000W 80+ Platinum, which is better than the gold this comes with. In my opinion, one of the things you should be willing to pay for is the PSU. It runs the *entire* system. I'd prefer my PSU to randomly not die, but that's just me. My point is: if there's a thing you should upgrade, get Platinum > Gold ($100).

Cooling ($85-100) 

<h5> Peripherials </h5>

Comes with a mouse/keyboard - put that at $100, to be generous. 

<h4> Conclusion </h4>



Total: You total up to (at most) $1670ish worth of parts. I'd personally be more willing to put it at $1550-1600. If you're fine with spending $300ish in labor + limited warranty, then absolutely go for it. No judgement whatsoever. 

It's not a *bad* PC, all things considered. I'd still probably, upgrade the PSU + grab more RAM, which the site that I listed allows you to do. It'll just get pricey. 


That said... my turn. 

## Option 1  - 4070 / i7-13700k

[PCPartPicker List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/QDTDTY)

Total: $1668.96 (2/15)

The reason this one's a little pricey is because of the processor. I have the motherboard and once I got the ethernet thing fixed, it's been smooth sailing. I've had no issues with my 3070 so I do not expect you to have any isssues either with the games you want to play.

I recognize this is very out of budget - I just wanted to leave it as an option.

This is actually very similar to what I have and if you're curious... [my pc](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/jZVfDZ). and yes, I know. It was expensive. But in my defense, I was unsupervised. and. :(



## Option 2 - 4070 / i5-12400F

[PCPartPicker List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6VRRyg)

Total: $1320.96

This PC is basically identical, the only difference is the processor. 



## Option 3 - 4070 / AMD Ryzen 7600X

Total: 1488.83 
[PCPartPicker List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6GMDTY)

We're back to DDR5! Better processor. Less of workhorse, less future-proof, less money. 


## Option 4 - 4070 / AMD Ryzen 5 5600x

Total: $1283.27 (there's $20 worth of discounts)


[PCPartPicker List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FffGN6)
We kept things pretty close to the Intel PCs - minus the processor. Now, per [UserBenchMark](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-13700K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-5600X/4137vs4084), the i7 is absolutely the better workhorse. You're looking at Stabble Diffusion, which is a GPU thing, so the processor is *nice* but not end of the world. 

Important note: You're on DDR4 with this build. Less expensive, less future-proof. 




# Notes

Right, so with the stuff I chucked together, I would budget a friendly \$200, 250 for a  monitor/keyboard/mouse. Just pick up something from Costco for the monitor, you'll get at least a little bit back with the whole Costco-annual-check-thing. Corsair has some okay keyboards for, eh \$50? 

Another thing to note, the only thing that's kinda a concern in the builds I did was the cooler. It's like $35. My guess it's either a) loud or b) not super reliable, but it's got good reviews. so...hm. It's also a fan, so you have to care a *little* bit more about whether or not it'll fit in the case. Should be an easy measurement though.
